# Welcome to My Playground

Hi! I'm **Arty**, a Computer Science student at **University of Maine Augusta (UMA)** with a focus on **web technologies**. This repository is my personal space to **experiment, learn, and play around with different website ideas**.  

I use these projects to **test new concepts, try out technologies, and improve my coding skills**. Nothing here is meant to be production-ready—it's all about learning and exploration.

## What You'll Find Here
- Experimental web projects
- Front-end and back-end experiments
- Fun and learning-focused mini-projects
- Notes and prototypes of ideas

## Connect With Me
Feel free to check out my projects, leave feedback, or make a branch if you want to have fun on some of my experiments.

*This is a personal learning space. All projects are works in progress.*
